## Introduction
For the fourth challenge, my task was to create from scratch a web page capable of running a timed quiz using JavaScript, CSS and HTML. To accomplish this task, I made use of my current abilities in logical thinking for the creation of the dynamic functions with JS and a more creative and visual approach to the styling of the page with HTML and CSS to replicate the visual representation given by the client.

## User Story

```
AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and my score
```

## Visual Web Application
Finally, I present the final visual result of the web application's appearance and functionality:

![A user clicks through an interactive coding quiz, then enters initials to save the high score before resetting and starting over.](./Assets/Images/Captura%20de%20pantalla%202024-01-21%20a%20la(s)%2010.12.23 a.m..png)
